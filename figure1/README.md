#### Examples of demographic models from the literature (Figure 1)

To run the script and obtain Figure 1 from the manuscript, load the jupyter notebook `figure_1_example_demography.ipynb` and execute all cells in this notebook. This will generate the pdf for Figure 1 `figure_1_example_demography.pdf`.

The script requires the python libraries `demesdraw` (0.4.0), `stdpopsim` (0.2.0), and `matplotlib` (3.8.2).
