#### SFS under neutrality and background selection (Figure 4)

To run the simulations and obtain Figure 4 from the manuscript, load the jupyter notebook `figure_4_sfs_background.ipynb` and execute all cells in this notebook. This will generate the pdf for Figure 4 `figure_4_sfs_background.pdf`.

The script requires that [SLiM 4](https://messerlab.org/slim/) is available on the command line and can be executed by calling `slim`. It futhermore requires the python libraries `numpy` (1.26.0), `pathlib2` (2.3.7), `subprocess` (Part of Python 3.9.18), `matplotlib` (3.8.2), `seaborn` (0.13.0), `pandas` (2.1.3), and `tqdm` ((4.66.1)).
