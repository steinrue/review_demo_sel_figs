#### Density of coalescent events, LD, and the joint SFS under different demographic models (Figure 2)

To run the simulations and obtain Figure 2 from the manuscript, load the jupyter notebook `figure_2_demo_stats.ipynb` and execute all cells in this notebook. This will generate the pdf for Figure 2 `figure_2_demo_stats.pdf`.

The script requires the python libraries `msprime` (1.2.0), `numpy` (1.26.0), `pathlib2` (2.3.7), `matplotlib` (3.8.2), `pickle` (Part of Python 3.9.18), `tqdm` (4.66.1), and `bz2` (Part of Python 3.9.18).
